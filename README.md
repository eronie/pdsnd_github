### Project Title
Bikeshare Data

### Description
This project creates an interactive program to view Bikeshare data from three different cities for the first half of 2017: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The user is able to view data from one city at a time and is then able to specify if they'd like to sort information by a particular day of the week, by a specific month, or view all data. Information automatically displayed includes information about the stations, trips, times, and user demographics. The user is also able to view raw data 5 rows at a time.
